'''
We have already done the viewHypernodeDist and preConnect functions in this folder.

The next step for us is for each hyper-node, we need to find the connected components.

These will be represented as green dots with lines connecting them if they are connected.

This will be stored in another JSON file in the same folder, which will be used to display the connected components.

That file is called "components.json".

Working!!!! As of 3, March 2025. 4:42 PM.
